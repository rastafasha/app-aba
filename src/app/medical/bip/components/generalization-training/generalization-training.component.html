                                                <p>As Client makes progress on the goals identified in this plan, specific strategies will be used to promote generalization across people and settings to improve the durability of the behavioral outcomes. To enhance generalization, lead analyst/Behavior assistant will collaborate with caregivers as well as the primary care physician, if requested.<br><br>
                                                    Specific strategies to facilitate generalization will include (training loosely or diversely, engaging support providers, using multiple exemplars, fading cues and prompts, variable reinforcement schedules, accessing natural and indiscriminate contingencies, and thinning schedules of reinforcement).<br><br>
                                                    Once caregivers demonstrate proficiency in the implementation of procedures, they should start to consistently implement the Behavior plan with Analyst’s supervision. Program will be conducted during daily living activities.<br><br>

                                                <p>Implementation of this intervention plan could be affected by the following: not consistent implementation of behavior plan by program implementers (caregivers, therapists). In an effort to overcome these barriers, we will monitor caregivers/ staff  to ensure that the implementation of the programs is occurring on consistent and appropriate basis. It is also important to avoid gaps in services to avoid disrupting progress or failing to acquire functional skills. In addition, maladaptive behaviors that put consumer at risk might escalate if treatment is withheld. <br><br>
                                                    Client’s maladaptive behaviors can have negative social consequences as others may avoid interaction with the client. Client needs close monitoring and external regulation. Non-compliance, prevents client from engaging in the acquisition of new behaviors that would foster learning, instruction following, independence and habituation to rule-bound settings, which pose subsequent risks. Maladaptive behaviors reduce opportunities for learning new things and interacting with peers. Helping Client communicate their needs, understand instructions and demands and regulate impulsive behavior is imperative to successful functioning in home, school and community settings.<br><br>  
                                                    Caregivers are to be trained on possible effects of treatment modalities such as Extinction Burst. Common effects of this intervention are an increase in the frequency of the target response (extinction burst) and increase in aggression (extinction-induced aggression). If parents/caregivers are not adequately trained to understand the process, they usually think that treatment is not working and make efforts to stop these interventions. <br><br>
                                                    Punishment procedures are not used in this program and least restrictive strategies are always encouraged first. In the case that Response Cost or Simple Corrections are used, procedures will be described and all people involved in treatment will learn and demonstrate how to use them and what the contingencies will be.
